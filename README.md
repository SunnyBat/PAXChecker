Save the file to your computer, then run it. If it doesn't run, check to make sure you have Java 7 or above installed. If not, you'll need to install it. Feel free to message or email me if you're having trouble running it.

Features
==========

-PAX Prime, East, South and Aus scanning capability

-Automatically open queue in your default web browser when found

-Get into queue before the Twitter notification! (This may change at any given time, but as far as I know you most likely will)

-Text as many phones as you want when queue is found (along with a link for if you don't have access to your computer!) (Standard messaging rates probably apply, but it's basically just a text message -- if you have unlimited texting you're most likely good)

-Can use any cell carrier that supports email text messages

-Program supports Yahoo! and GMail for sending texts (GMail highly recommended. Other emails may be used -- see the in-program 

-Instructions for how to set this up)

-Supports AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, TMobile and U.S. Cellular by default (all other carriers require you to go to 
emailtextmessages.com and put your carrier's ending after your cell number -- see the in-program Instructions for details)

-Play an alarm through your speakers when tickets are found

-Specify how often to check for tickets (10-60 seconds, to reduce request spamming and data usage)

-Track how much data is used

-Minimize program to taskbar (only tested on Windows)

-Ability to save all selected options (except password) for quick program starting every day

-Automatically detect and offer to download new program versions (with patch notes)
