        <h1>Important Note</h1>
        You should NOT rely on only one way of PAX Ticket sale notifications.
        Sign up for the @Official_PAX Twitter notifications
        <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170004-fast-following-on-sms">via text</a>.
        Watch the Reddit Live thread (if there is one). Make sure your friends
        know to text you if they find out. Do NOT miss out because you relied on only
        one form of notification!<br>
        So far, the program beat the Twitter notification for PAX Prime 2014 and
        PAX South 2015. The Twitter notification came out before the program found
        the link for PAX East 2015, which has hopefully been fixed. Still, don't
        rely on only one notification form!

        <h1>Email and Password</h1>
        <b>If you do not want to receive a text message when tickets are found,
            simply leave these fields blank.</b><br>
        Your email is used to send a text message when tickets are found. Currently,
        there are two internally supported email services: <b>Gmail</b> and <b>Yahoo!</b>.
        Simply type in your email address to use these. For information on using
        different email services, see the Additional Information section.<br>
        Gmail generally takes 30-45 seconds to receive a sent text. <em>This is
            the recommended option.</em><br>
        Yahoo! is very inconsistent with texts -- it can take anywhere from 10
        <em>seconds</em> to 15 <em>minutes</em> to receive a text from Yahoo!<br>
        <em>For information on why your email is required for sending texts, see
            the Additional Information section.</em><br>

        <h1>Cell Number (Texting)</h1>
        Your cell number is required to text to your phone. The program natively
        upports AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular in the US, and Bell, Rogers,
        Fido, Koodo, Telus, Virgin, Wind, and SaskTel in Canada. If you have
        any of these carriers, simply select yours from the dropdown menu.
        If you have a different carrier, you'll need to go to
        <a href="http://www.emailtextmessages.com">emailtextmessages.com</a> and
        get the ending for your carrier.<br>
        Please note that standard messaging rates most likely apply. Please
        ensure that your plan either includes SMS/MMS messages or you're willing
        to receive additional fees. Most smartphone plans come with unlimited
        SMS/MMS messages.<br>
        You can put dashes and parentheses into your number. For example, 012-345-6789
        is just as valid as (012)-345-6789. Your number is automatically converted
        into a format with no dashes or parentheses -- just numbers. Overall,
        the email is sent in the format of 0123456789@car.rier.net. For example,
        if your number is 0123456789 and your provider is 3 River Wireless,
        you would put 0123456789@sms.3rivers.net in the Cell Num field.<br>
        To text multiple numbers, simply add another number using the button
        provided. There is no hard-coded limit for how many numbers you may
        text. Each additional number should follow all of the instructions above.<br>
        <i><b>AH! What's the difference between "AT&T (MMS)" and "AT&T (SMS)"???</b></i><br>
        Selecting the MMS option sends the message as a multimedia message.
        This preserves the email sender information (you receive the text from
        your email address) and shortens the length. This is the recommended
        option to use. Unlimited texting plans <i>most likely</i> include
        multimedia texts.<br>
        The SMS option sends the message as a text message. You receive
        it from a 210-extension number, and it includes "FRM", "SUBJ" and "MSG"
        information, increasing the message length and decreasing readability.
        Not recommended, as text messages have a character limit of 160
        characters, and the text from the program might go over 160 characters.<br>

        <h1>Scan PAX Registration Website</h1>
        This scans the selected PAX registration website for the "Register Now" button.
        It checks PAX.paxsite.com/registration (obviously PAX is the expo you're checking).<br>
        This uses the most bandwidth (still not very much). It's recommended to
        use this option if you really want tickets, as the website will eventually
        be updated with this, regardless of whether or not it's before or after the
        Twitter notification.

        <h1>Scan Showclix Website</h1>
        This scans the Showclix API (<a href="https://api.showclix.com">api.showclix.com</a>) for the
        selected PAX expo's most recent ticket sale.<br>
        <b>This option is highly recommended.</b> The Showclix website is updated first in order
        to get the link to the ticket queue, which this program finds using the Showclix API. It
        uses a small amount of bandwidth, and will mostly likely find the tickets before the PAX
        Registration Website option.<br>
        Credit goes to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GrahamArthurBlair">/u/GrahamArthurBlair</a>
        for his original Showclix API scanning code.<br><br>

        <h1>Scan @Official_PAX Twitter</h1>
        This scans the @Official_PAX Twitter feed for announcements. This will detect any
        links PAX puts out, whether or not they're Showclix links. Thus, be ready for false
        positives.<br>
        Links found by scanning the Showclix API will be opened a few seconds before others
        receive them via text. Thus, receiving notifications via text for Twitter links
        is almost guaranteed to be useless, as you'll receive Twitter notifications before
        the email text message.<br>
        The Twitter option has not been used on an actual ticket release. Testing done has
        shown that the option is able to successfully open links posted via Twitter, however
        there's no guarantee that it will work (as with any part of the program).<br>
        <b>API keys???</b><br>
        API keys are required to use the Twitter option. API keys are sensitive information,
        and as such are not safe to put directly into an open-source application.<br>
        To use them, see
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PAXChecker/comments/2nct50/how_to_set_up_twitter_checking/">here</a>.

        <h1>Additional Information</h1>

        <h2>Why Does This Need my Email Password?</h2>
        An email is required to send a text message. It's the simplest way to send
        a text message, and anyone can use it.<br>
        There are several reasons why your email and password is required:
        <ul>
            <li>You must authenticate your login to send an email using your account
                username and password</li>
            <li>This program is open-source. If there was a hard-coded username and
                password, anyone would be able to find it in this program at any time and
                disable texting for everyone. Using your email address prevents this from
                happening.</li>
            <li>Having one email address send out potentially dozens (modestly) of
                emails within 60 seconds is very fishy, and multiple logins from different
                locations will lock out the email after a few emails. This means only a few
                people would actually get the text.</li>
            <li>You will recognize the sender of your text</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using a Different Email Provider</h2>
        For sending an email using a different email provider, several things are required:
        <ul>
            <li>The service must use SMTP and TLS</li>
            <li>You must know the SMTP server address</li>
            <li>You must know the SMTP server port</li>
        </ul>
        Once you have this information, you must input this after your email address
        and two colons (::). If the server uses a port other than 587, you must
        add the port after the server and a colon (:).<br>
        An example:<br>
        Emailaddress@someprovider.com::provider.smpt.server:999<br>
        <b>Note that this is very experimental. Make sure to test your text message every time!</b>
